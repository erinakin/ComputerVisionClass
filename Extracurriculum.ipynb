    "  * How would you calculate your grocery bill for the month and for the year using tensors?\n",
    "* Go through the [TensorFlow 2.x quick start for beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) tutorial (be sure to type out all of the code yourself, even if you don't understand it).\n",
    "  * Are there any functions we used in here that match what's used in there? Which are the same? Which haven't you seen before?\n",
    "* Watch the video [\"What's a tensor?\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5liqUk0ZTw) - a great visual introduction to many of the concepts we've covered in this notebook."
