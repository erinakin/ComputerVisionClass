    "The aim of this assignment is to use Harris Corner Detection to identify corner points from a checkerboard \n",
    "pattern  for  camera  calibration.  Students  will  extract  3D  and  2D  points,  and  then  calculate  the \n",
    "camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by following the methodology outlined in Lecture 2 slides. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Instructions: \n",
    "Step 1: Setup \n",
    "1.  Print or use a pre-existing checkerboard pattern with known square dimensions (e.g., 25mm x 25mm \n",
    "3  \n",
    "per square). \n",
    "2.  Place the checkerboard in a room setting at different positions and orientations. Ensure the pattern is \n",
    "fully visible in each image. \n",
    "3.  Capture  at  least 5 images of  the  checkerboard  from  different  perspectives  using  a  smartphone  or \n",
    "camera. Make sure the camera remains fixed between shots. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Step 2: Harris Corner Detection \n",
    "1.  Detect Corners: \n",
    "o Use the Harris Corner Detection algorithm to find corner points on the checkerboard in each \n",
    "captured image. \n",
    "o Highlight the detected corners on the image for visualization. \n",
    "o Refine  the  corner  points  using sub-pixel  corner  detection (e.g., cv2.cornerSubPix in \n",
    "OpenCV). \n",
    "2.  Select Corresponding Points: \n",
    "o Identify the corresponding 3D world points for each detected corner. Assume: \n",
    "¬ß The checkerboard lies on the z=0 plane. \n",
    "¬ß The top-left corner of the checkerboard is the origin (0,0,0). \n",
    "¬ß Each square's size is known (e.g., 25mm). \n",
    "o Pair the detected 2D image points (from Harris Corner Detection) with their respective 3D \n",
    "world points. \n",
    " \n",
    "Step 3: Camera Calibration \n",
    "1.  Intrinsic and Extrinsic Parameters: \n",
    "o Use  the Lecture  2  slides to  calculate  the  camera‚Äôs intrinsic  parameters (focal  length, \n",
    "principal point, and skew) and extrinsic parameters (rotation and translation matrices). \n",
    "o Perform these calculations programmatically using a library like OpenCV or manually in \n",
    "Python based on the formulas provided in the lecture. \n",
    "o Derive the intrinsic matrix K and the extrinsic parameters [R‚à£t] for each image. \n",
    " \n",
    "Step 4: Evaluate and Verify \n",
    "1.  Reprojection: \n",
    "o Reproject the 3D points onto the image plane using the calculated parameters. \n",
    "o Compare  the  reprojected  points  with  the  original  detected  2D  points  from  Harris  Corner \n",
    "Detection. \n",
    "2.  Reprojection Error: \n",
    "o Calculate the reprojection error to evaluate the accuracy of your calibration. \n",

    "Deliverables \n",
    "1.  Images and Detected Corners: \n",
    "o Include the original images with the Harris-detected corners clearly highlighted. Ensure the \n",
    "visualization is clear, using markers (e.g., circles, squares) to show the detected corners. \n",
    "2.  Camera Parameters: \n",
    "o Provide the calculated Intrinsic Parameters, including: \n",
    "o Provide the Extrinsic Parameters for each image: \n",
